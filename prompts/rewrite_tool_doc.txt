Your task is to create a concise and effective tool usage description based on the tool documentation. You should ensure the description only contains the purposes of the tool without irrelevant information. Here is an example:
{Tool Documentation} 
Tool usage description: 
{Tool_name} is a tool that can {General_Purposes}. 
This tool has {Number of Functions} multiple built-in functions: 
1. {Function_1} is to {Functionality_of_Function_1} 
2. {Function_2} is to ...

You've previously explored the api under this tool and refined the api_description based on the results returned by the api, and you need to integrate this information to give a better tool_description. Let's begin!
{Tool Description} 
Be sure to use the following formatted Markdown code snippet, and please return a parsable JSON. Just output the JSON. 

```json
{
    "tool_description": str
}
```
